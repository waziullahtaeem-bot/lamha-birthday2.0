    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We were both born on 9th September 2006. I was at dawn, Lamha at evening — two souls of the same sun 🌅🌆.</p>
    <p>You mean everything to me, Lamha. 🌙✨</p>

    <h2>When the Storm Ends</h2>
    <div id="poemBook">
      <div class="page" data-author="Wazi">
        <p>I hope the storms embrace me in their comfort.<br>
        I hope the rain reminds me of you.<br>
        I hope the stars hide away among the clouds —<br>
        like my dreams in your absence.<br><br>
        I hope I finally find peace in the memories that come with the rain —<br>
        of you, of us, of the future we dreamt.<br><br>
        Let us be one the day the storm ends.<br>
        Let us be one when the rainbow breaks through the silence, after the rain.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page" data-author="Lamha">
        <p>As the war finally ends, we look around in search of each other.<br>
        Our bodies covered with scars, blood streaming down like rivers,<br>
        yet our hearts search for the other one.<br><br>
        At last, when your eyes fall on me, a smile cracks on your face.<br>
        My face enlightens to see yours.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page" data-author="Wazi">
        <p>As we face each other in the aftermath of war,<br>
        our eyes full of dreams and hopes reignite our hearts to pursue even greater heights.<br><br>
        We walk toward each other with hearts full of longing and distance.<br>
        Finally, in the embrace of each other — we find peace, we find our home.<br><br>
        As God writes the end to our story, a story to be read for ages to come,<br>
        a saga for generations — yet this was just the beginning of a story yet to find its climax.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page" data-author="Lamha">
        <p>As we slowly walk towards each other, awaiting to touch, waiting for this nightmare to end...<br><br>
        As we two hug, our hearts finally melt.<br>
        Emotions overflow.<br>
        Tears flow nonstop — both of us unable to express our happiness.<br><br>
        As God smiles upon us, our storybook finally comes to an end.</p>
